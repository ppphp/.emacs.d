* my emacs configure

I mostly use emacs to do some stuff without database.

My emacs configure should be consist of some main components, but I am too weak to make it to be true.

Layout:
A project meta info area like treemacs frame.
An Editable area like usual buffer.
An repl are like multi term, debug tools.
A simple message panel.

Meta info and repl should be dedicated with project.
